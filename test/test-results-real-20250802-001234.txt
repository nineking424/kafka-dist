Kafka Kubernetes Deployment REAL Test Results
============================================
Date: Sat Aug 2 00:12:34 KST 2025
Total Tests: 5
Passed: 1
Failed: 4

Test Results:
-------------
✅ Namespace Creation: PASSED - Namespace 'kafka' created successfully
❌ Single-Node Deployment: FAILED - Could not create test topic
❌ Cluster Deployment: FAILED - Controller pods did not become ready
❌ Service Connectivity: FAILED - No services found
❌ Persistent Storage: FAILED - No PVCs found

Status: ❌ SOME TESTS FAILED

Detailed Analysis:
-----------------

1. Namespace Creation: SUCCESS
   - The kafka namespace was successfully created

2. Single-Node Deployment: PARTIAL SUCCESS / FAILED
   - Pod kafka-0 started successfully and reached Running status
   - However, Kafka broker failed to initialize properly
   - Could not create test topic, indicating Kafka service issues

3. Cluster Deployment: FAILED
   - Controller pods failed to become ready within 180 seconds
   - The script has a bug in line 97 causing comparison errors
   - Pods were created but never reached Ready state

4. Service Connectivity: FAILED
   - Could not test service connectivity due to previous failures
   - Services were likely created but pods weren't ready

5. Persistent Storage: FAILED
   - PVCs were not tested due to previous deployment failures

Issues Identified:
-----------------
1. Script Bug: Line 97 in test-deployment-real.sh has a comparison error
   - The ready_pods count parsing is returning multi-line output
   - This causes "integer expression expected" errors

2. Kafka Configuration Issues:
   - Single-node Kafka started but couldn't create topics
   - Cluster controllers never became ready
   - May indicate KRaft configuration problems

3. Possible Root Causes:
   - Incorrect KAFKA_NODE_ID configuration for controllers
   - Controller quorum voters configuration may be incorrect
   - Storage class or PVC binding issues
   - Resource constraints in the cluster

Recommendations:
---------------
1. Fix the script bug in wait_for_pods function (line 97)
2. Debug Kafka pod logs to identify initialization failures
3. Verify KRaft configuration, especially node IDs and quorum voters
4. Check cluster resource availability (CPU, memory, storage)
5. Test with simpler configurations first before full cluster deployment

Test Environment:
----------------
- Kubernetes Version: v1.30.3
- Test Mode: Real deployment with automatic cleanup
- Namespace: kafka
- Cleanup: Successful (all resources removed after test)
